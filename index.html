    Hello, My name is Jesse DenBeste and I am from Bedford, Texas I enjoy Running. I work in a call center job,
    right now.
    I am trying to get a better job and start a career in programming. I have always want to learn new languages and
    wanted a
    job that I could use them in, that will pay well. </p>

        My coutry is a place of great opertunity and growth, if you are willing to fight for it. Nothing in life is
        easy
        nothing in life is free. I only have freedom becuase of the price others have paid for me and those who live
        hear.
        The bill always comes due and someone always pays the tab. I will one pay the tab for another, I am sure as
        others
        have paid for me and this great land of liberty.
