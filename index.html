            Hello, My name is Jesse Den Beste and I am from Bedford, Texas, I enjoy Running. I work in a call center
            job, right now. I am trying to get a better job and start a career in programming. I have always wanted to
            learn new
            languages and wanted a job that I could use them in, that will pays well. I love quotes and one of my
            favorite
            quotes is from grand mother. Mildred Bathel "love is a conscious choice, not an automatic responce." I like
            writing
            and someday I would like to write a book. I love this quote as well by Mark Twain - "Out of All the Things I
            Have Lost,
            I Miss My Mind the Most." I am very much an advocate for mental health awareness. The world is becoming
            increasingly complex
            and with that complexity come mental strain and anguish. Mental illness is a symptom of this, the world
            could use some
            peace and quiet, a respite to heal. </p>

        <h2> United States of America </h2>

        <p>
            My country is a place of great opportunity and growth, if you are willing to fight for it. Nothing in
            life
            is easy, nothing in life is free.
            I only have freedom because of the price others have paid for me and those who live
            here.
            The bill always comes due and someone always pays the tab. I will one day pay the tab, I am sure as
            others
            have paid for me and this great land of liberty.
