                <h1 class="div-h1">Trips for Hope</h1>
                <p> These trips are for heal teh wounds of life so don't bring your weapons of war here. This is a place
                    for the high law a place peace where you can search and find the love you lost. The love for
                    yourself or your love of life whatever love it is. We are told many things we should do in life, the
                    greater of these things i believe is to love. Love does not judge or belittle it is kind and
                    patient. Love is not a victim or an agresser, incent or corrupt. Love is the higher law. It does
                    what it says it frees and inhibits, guides and directs. It keeps the Covenants it has made pure and
                    simple. Love builds and strengthens, creates and constructs. Love does not tears down and crushes,
                    destorys and levels. Love is the tool of the Father and the weapon of peace. Love hammers the nail
                    and takes it out. Love is kindness of strangers and the saftey of peace. It takes and it gives the
                    like water in the desert and waves on the beach. Love is all, that has been given, will be given,
                    and can be given. Through love and only through love, He is Rizen!

                    elsewhere. listen to the guide and he will get you through, it will help you get away for a little
                    and just enjoy the power of nature.</p>
