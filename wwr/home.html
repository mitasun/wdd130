                <h1 class="div-h1">Welcome to Rafting for Hope</h1>
                <p>Welcome! Welcome! if you have come here looking for a connection a maybe a direction or maybe to
                    just, HOPE.
                    you have comme to the right place. The world is dark and forboading it is all that surrounds us. Yet
                    all of us have a light that can not be exstinguished by all the darkness around it. So what better
                    to do the
                    nurture that light with HOPE. That what it is all about here, a place to encourage and discover that
                    light and let it
                    shine. If you have hidden that light well here is the place to excavate that hidden light. You are
                    welcome here you are
                    not judged here, This is place of HOPE. HOPE that you are not alone, because you are not. When we
                    get on the water it
                    will challenge you physicaly and mentally. Here you can forget emotion for a while so you can step
                    back and look for
                    the bigger picture that is you. The things you need will be provided for you, but that does not mean
                    it will be easy or that you
                    will you have to do nothing. I guarantee you will have to dig deep and search your heart and soul
                    for the very thing you have
                    been hidding and bring it out. You will have to face some hard things like, why did you hide it.
                    What is keeping you from
                    searching. When did you start, where are you going, and of course, who do you want your light shine
                    on.

                <p>The choices we make in this life will echo forever in the eternities. We have already chosen to come and serve, whom will you serve. Will you serve he who sent you, your deliver from darkness, he who is rizen. The son of God He who was sent and paid your debt, suffered to sancitfy and satisfy the law. The concure of Death and the king of Kings. You can choose him or The He who wished to take your agency and all that you are and cast you into the darkness. He that sought glory only for himself, he who fell with those who followed him. He who denined the Father who created him. He who wanted your debt to rule over you. Him who wished to break the law and make cared not for the price you would pay. The price of sorrow and nothingness, promising you bondage through guilt and ignorance of all but, what you gave up to loose all that you have. May you find the love you need, not just the love you seek.
